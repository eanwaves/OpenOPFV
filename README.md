# OpenOPFV
Open Optimal Power Flow Simulator.

At OSCON 2019, we announced that the optimal power flow simulator will be open sourced on the 50th anniversary of the Moonshot. For a description of the technology and usecases behind this project, please see https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/76254
This initial simulator can be run on a Mac OSX environment. Test data will be added and we encourage users and contributors to add their own to this repository (see Bus.h). We welcome anyone involved with OPF uses, research and development. We encourge those to download it, run it, and contribute to this in any way, including documentation, test data, code, and even comments with criticism or suggestions for further improving upon it. We wanted to thank EAN and Caltech, the main contributors to the research and development behind this IoT smart energy, edge compute project. We believe that starting with this project, and the tens of millions of IoT devices already deployed in power grids everywhere, IoT will be to Energy what the Internet was to Telephony. We are confident that by collaborating and working on this together as a community, we will be able to solve the challenging problems related to reverse power flows that ignited the wildfire disasters as discussed in the OSCON 2019 talk.
